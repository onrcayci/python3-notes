# python3-notes

My Notes on Important Intermediate and Advanced Features of Python 3. I only took note of the things I thought will be useful during coding interviews or challenges. Also I tried to take note of the special or handy information that can be easily overlooked or forgotten. This is not a full cheat sheet, but it includes helpful things like list comprehensions, lambda functions, Object Oriented Programming tricks for Python etc.
